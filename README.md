BibTeX entry from URL
=============

A simple chrome extension that creates a BibTeX entry for the URL in the current tab. Tab's title and url are automatically copied to be used in your LaTeX documents. Author needs to be filled in manually.

For http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging.html we get:

    @misc{Packa8:online,
    author = {},
    title = {Packaging - Google Chrome},
    howpublished = {\url{https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/packaging}},
    month = {},
    year = {},
    note = {(Visited on 06/10/2014)}
    }
